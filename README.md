## Installation Guide

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have these installed:
- Node.js 20.x  
- Docker Desktop (with Docker Engine running)  
- pnpm via Corepack (ships with Node 20)  

---

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kronera/CptS421AWWGr23.git
cd CptS421AWWGr23/code
```

### 2. Start PostgreSQL (Docker)
```bash
cd infra
docker compose up -d
# Verify container
docker ps --filter "ancestor=postgres:16"
cd ..
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables
```bash
# CMS
cp apps/cms/.env.example apps/cms/.env

# Web
cp apps/web/.env.example apps/web/.env.local
```

### 4. Install Dependencies
```bash
pnpm install
```
This installs dependencies for all workspace apps (CMS & Web).

### 5. Run the CMS (Strapi)
```bash
cd apps/cms
pnpm build   # first time only
pnpm develop # starts http://localhost:1337/admin
```
On first run:
- Create your Strapi admin account.
- Strapi will automatically load existing Content Types (`Event`, `Story`, `Sponsor`, etc.) from the repository.
- Optional: seed initial entries or publish existing ones if needed.

### 6. Run the Web (Next.js)
```bash
cd ../web
pnpm dev
```
Open [http://localhost:3000/events](http://localhost:3000/events) — your published event should appear.
